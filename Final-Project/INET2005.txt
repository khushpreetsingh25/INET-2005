Open the application in your web browser:

Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by the php artisan serve command. If it's the default, you can open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

You can now navigate to the routes you've defined. For example:

To view the category creation form: http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories/create
To view the list of categories: http://127.0.0.1:8000/categories
To view the item creation form: http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/create
To view the list of items: http://127.0.0.1:8000/items
Remember, the actual URLs might vary depending on your environment and configurations.

If you encounter any errors or issues, make sure to check the console output for any error messages. Additionally, check your Laravel logs located in the storage/logs directory for more detailed information about any errors.
